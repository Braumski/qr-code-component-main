## My process

  I started with the card, but I had to figure out how to center something within the entire html document, I had to set the html to flex and I set it to justify-center and set the flex direction to column. I can't believe I didnt even know how to center within an html doc. Getting the image to fit was difficult too, but I learned that you set the height to auto and you make the width a percentage of its container or however many pixels you want. I strict width and an auto height is very useful.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I had to refer to some guides to figure out how to make an image fit neatly into its parent box. I also had to lookup how I would center content on an entire html page. I couldve just used the html page as the parent element and flex boxed it, and I should have known that, but I reached for googling how to do it too quickly. I shouldve taken more time to think about its because thats something I definitely could have done without looking it up.

### Continued development

I feel like this could have been done with a lot less CSS code... The image is so simple yet my code is pretty heavy... Also using position-relative on the paragraph did not seem like the proper solution, but it worked. I feel like there was somethign else I could have done.

I want CSS to become second nature and I need to practice how to micro-manipulate text and image to get the absolute exact sizes im looking for. I also need to figure out how to layout pages without referring to a sheet with flex box and grid. I guess these will come with practice.

Javascript is what I need to move on to next, but I need more of these frontend mentor practice guides for my css first.

### Useful resources

This was great for helping me understand that there are actually many ways to center something in CSS. I went with the flexbox route because it seemed to have the fewest bits of code. Hopefully that was the best way to do it.

I was setting the width and height to a strict amount of pixels and I didn't really have an idea of how to properly fit the image into the card div that I was making. This website helped me clear up how to make a responsive image and I hope I don't forget this from here on out.
